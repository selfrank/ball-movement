Simulation of Ball Movement Using Looping Methods

I am student in the MITxPro program and we had an assignment to make a ball move around the screen. We were then challenged to make it do more things such as have multiple balls, change colors, change velocity etc. This is my expanded project. 

Skills used to design this project
1. Defining an object
2. Setting a barrier for object movment and detecting edge
3. Looping for ball animation
4. Applying images files to object
5. Using setInterval for looping movment
6. Setting conditions and pushing changes to values based on condition results
7. Creating multiple objects with different conditions. 
8. Setting background colors to page
9. Adding a header using html
