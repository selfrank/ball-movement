Simulation of Ball Movement Using Looping Methods

I am student in the MITxPro program and we had an assignment before learning almost any Javascript to make a ball move around the screen. We were then challenged to make it do more things such as have multiple balls, change colors, change velocity etc. This is my expanded project.
